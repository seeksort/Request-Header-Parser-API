# Request-Header-Parser-API

(Node.js, HTML/CSS) An API that will return a JSON object with the user's IP address, browser language, and operating system.

Another little project where I was practicing with the HTTP module rather than Express, but I used other little modules to parse the headers I needed.

This is one of the [Free Code Camp API projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/request-header-parser-microservice).
