# Request-Header-Parser-API

(Node.js, HTML/CSS) An API that will return a JSON object with the user's IP address, browser language, and operating system.

Another little project where I was practicing with the HTTP module rather than Express, but I used other little modules to parse the headers I needed.

This is one of the [Free Code Camp API projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/request-header-parser-microservice).

## 03.10.2018 Update: Flask

I made a Flask version (Python framework) of this app, because I wanted to try out Flask. It is located in the [flask-api branch](https://github.com/seeksort/Request-Header-Parser-API/tree/flask-api).
